# Cancer-Survival-Prediction
A model prediction of cancer servival.

# Problem introduction
- The ability to predict survival chance for cancer patient provides crucial information for making medical decision.
- Survival chance depends on patient and tumor characteristics.
- Patient basic characteristics were graded by clinicians through interviews and blood tests.
- Tumor characteristics were collected via imaging followed by manual annotations by doctors and automatic image processing.
- Can we predict the patient's survival chance with these information?

# The dataset
- Here, we have put together an anonymized dataset of 197 cancer patients.
- There are 6 patient characteristics and 842 image-based features (v1-v842) extracted from radiological imaging data.
- Because image-based features are extracted from region-of-interest (ROI) annotated by doctors, and because each doctor draws different ROI, the values for some of them can vary a lot from doctor to doctor.
- We have provided data for 30 patients whose imaging data were annotated by 3 doctors each for you to explore the variations caused by ROI drawing.

# The tasks
- Develop and present a prediction model for patient's survival status at 3-year mark.
- Explore variability in radiomic features (v1-v482) using the data from 30 patients.
- Address the issue of variability feature values in your model performance evaluation.
